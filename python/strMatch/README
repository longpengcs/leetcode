string matching is very useful,and there are many algorithms.
some algorithms easy to understand but has big time complexity.
such as brute force,horspool,sunday,these algorithm has a big
time complexity( O(M*N)),but sometimes it is faster than some liner time
complexity algoritm,when m is small or string has a low repeatability(
such as word matching).
other algorithm,like kmp, is suitable for stirng has high repeatability(
such as gentic matching).
